### Hi,I'm Sonal Shabir! 
I'm a 3rd Year, CSE Undergraduate studying at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. 
I'm also currently specializing in Big Data Analytics as part of my course curriculum, my professional electives being Data Mining and Data Science. 
I'm currently learning HTML/CSS, Power BI, WEKA and R. These programming languages and data visualizers heavily contribute to the path I want to take in the far future. 
I'm collaborating with my classmates to create a Full Stack chatroom application. (Computer Networks)
That's pretty much it! 
Check out my repositories below :))
